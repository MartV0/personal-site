Here is a short list of some of my projects!

- **[My dotfiles](https://github.com/MartV0/dotfiles/):** My personal dotfiles,
  including configuration for neovim, qtile, (doom)emacs and more!
  They're probably a bit to personalised to me to be used by someone else directly, 
  but could be useful to have a look for inspiration.
- **[This website](https://github.com/MartV0/personal-site):** My personal website!
- **[AliExpresPaymentsParser](https://github.com/MartV0/AliExpresPaymentsParser/):** 
  A small script I wrote for my sister that parses AliExpress payment pdf's into an excel file.
